        <title> K-12 STEM Outreach </title>
        <h1> K-12 STEM Outreach </h1>
        <h2><i> Overview </i></h2>
        <p> Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), is the future of our world. STEM related programs and careers have grown so 
        much within the past 10 years, and continue to grow everyday. Young children, and students are surrounded by technology in their personal
        lives and in academia. Being surrounded by technology everyday can spark early interest in robotics, engineering, and other large industries
        that make up STEM related careers. The Global Window on Higher Education mentions that it is necessary for higher education instituates
        to involve themselves in education outreach to contribute to aligning the curricula with the needs of their community. K-12 Outreach is so 
        important in every grade and I will be discussing why it is important on each level.</p>
        
        <p> Many interests and hobbies are formed at a young age. Technology is growing so rappidly, that kids today might not get a chance experience 
        simple, yet useful parts of technology. Introducing the basics of technology and simple technology projects to Elementary students, helps spark an
        interest for technology and keeps their interest for future project. While many young students may already have an idea of what technology is, 
        as it surrounds their everyday lives, they are never too young to begin learning the basics of technology, how it works, and what path they are
        able to take with technology. </p>
        
        <p> Outreach in Junior High is probably the most important because students get to apply the basics of technology to challenging projects that stimulate the brain.
        When STEM is included in education, the ambitious structural practices help students solve and engage in real-world problems. Coding is a great
        way to learn how to problem solve, as the program will not run if there is an error, and most programs give you an idea of where you made a mistake.
        Activities and projects like this really help students understand how technology works and how to solve problems on their owm. This is important in 
        Middle school because students are just starting to find what their interested in and how to problem solve in other areas other than coding. </p>
        
        <p> High school is when K-12 Outreach hits its peak. When young professionals and students in related fields come to speak or give students tours
        around campus, it gives students transitioning into college the opportunity to ask questions in a personal setting. Many times, students don't ask
        questions in large crowds because they are too shy, but when you are reaching out and serving these students they are in a much more comfortable 
        sitation to ask questions about college and the coursework. One of the best things about High School Outreach is making connections with incoming
        students, giving them a familiar face on campus when they become a little fish in a big pond. Overall, K-12 Outreach not only helps students interested
        in STEM grow, but it helps our community and future grow. </p>
        
        <q> Ask what do you want now, to free yourself from thinking about the limitations of the technology and let your imagination take you 
        to what things do you want to have done, what problems do you want to solve </q>

        <p> Why STEM Outreach is Important: </p>
        <li> Allows K-12 students to ask questions from those who are in different STEM programs </li>
        <li> Helps students understand the importance of STEM and help them think of paths to take as STEM is a growing field </li>
        <li> Peaks the interest of various technology topics and </li>
